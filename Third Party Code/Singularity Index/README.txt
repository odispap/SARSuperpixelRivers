You will find MATLAB code for the 2D singularity index under the folder 'Code'. Also, you will find a folder called 'SingularityIndexResultsPDFFiles'. This folder contains PDF files showing examples of images on which the index has been run. You will also find comparison with the second derivative operator and Lindeberg's ridge strength measure. Please read the 'Description_of_Files.pdf' in this folder for more details.

If you use the 2D singularity index code in your research, then please cite the following papers:
