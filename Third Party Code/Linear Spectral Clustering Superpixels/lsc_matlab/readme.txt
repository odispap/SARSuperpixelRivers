This program demonstrates the LSC superpixel segmentation method proposed in the following papers:

Jiansheng Chen, Zhengqin Li, Bo Huang, Linear Spectral Clustering Superpixel, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 26, No. 7, pp. 3317-3330, 2017.

Zhengqin Li, Jiansheng Chen, Superpixel Segmentation using Linear Spectral Clustering, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Jun. 2015  

The program is free for non-commercial academic use. Any commercial use is strictly prohibited without the authors' consent. 

1. compile LSC_mex.cpp under Matlab using command:  mex LSC_mex.cpp
2. run LSC_demo.m under Matlab to try! 

You may also compile the mex file yourself using "mex LSC_mex.cpp" under matlab. This demo is also available at http://jschenthu.weebly.com/projects.html.
